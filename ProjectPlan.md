# IS477
Final project for IS477: Elina Sharma &amp; Victor Liu

# Overview: 
To study relationships between host star properties and exoplanet parameters, through integration of SIMBAD's stellar data and NASA's exoplanet catalog.

# Research Question(s): 
The relationship between host star temperature and planet equilibrium temperature. The relationship between stellar mass, number of exoplanets, and their corresponding masses.

# Team: 
## Elina:
- Ethical data handling (Module 2)
- Storage and organization (Modules 4/5)
- Extraction and enrichment (Module 6)
- Data integration (Module 7/8)
- Workflow automation and provenance (Module 11/12)
## Victor:
- Data lifecycle (Module 1)
- Data collection and acquisition (Module 3)
- Data cleaning (Module 10)
- Data quality (Module 9)
- Reproducibility and transparency (Module 13)
- Metadata and data documentation (Module 15)

# Datasets: 
## NASA exoplanet archive:
Catalog of confirmed and candidate exoplanets with physical and orbital parameters
- https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PSCompPars
## SIMBAD astronomical database:
Astronomical database which provides measurements for astronomical objects outside the solar system out of which we are using the stellar database
- https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/

# Timeline: 
## October
- Acquisition of datasets (Victor)
- Selecting storage/organization strategy (Elina)
## November
- Data integration (Victor/Elina)
- Data quality assessments (Victor)
- Data cleaning (Victor/Elina)
- Creating automated end-to-end workflow (Elina)
- Data documentation (provenance, reproducibility/transparency, metadata) (Victor/Elina)
## December
- Final checks (Victor/Elina)

# Constraints: 
- There could be issues in cross matching by host star name due to different naming conventions across datasets.
- The parameters could have different error margins across the datasets
- Confirmed exoplanets are observationally biased towards nearby, bright stars

# Gaps: 
- We have yet to learn some of the content (Module 9 onwards) and techniques so we are missing the skills and steps needed to answer our research questions.
